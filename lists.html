    <h1>Virat Kohli BioData</h1><hr>
    <p><u>Virat Kohli</u> was born on  ,<mark>5 November 1988</mark>  in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi" target="_blank" title="place">Delhi </a>into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a
    criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. <br> He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister,
    <a href="https://zeenews.india.com/cricket/who-is-bhawna-kohli-dhingra-the-only-sister-of-virat-kohli-and-part-of-cricketer-s-fashion-brand-2641053.html" targrt="_blank" title="sister">Bhawna</a> .</p>
    <h2>2008-2009:International Debut</h2><hr>
    <p>In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy" target="_blank" title="Trophy">Champions Trophy</a> in
    Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt.
    So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar" target="_blank" title="cricket  God">Sachin Tendulkar </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virender_Sehwag" target="_blank" title="Agressive Hitter">Virender Sehwag</a> , were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of
    makeshift opener throughout the series.</p>
    <h2>2009-2010:Rise Through the Ranks</h2><hr>
    <p>In January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as Tendulkar was rested for
    the event.[65] During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries before the age of
    22.[66] He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with
    275 runs from five innings at an impressive average of 91.66.[67] Kohli's success on the field belies the stereotype of
    him as a brash and arrogant player. In fact, Indian captain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni" target="_blank" title="Captain Cool">MS Dhoni</a> has noted that "he has grabbed his chances" and
    that "he has matured now." Dhoni went on to say that "To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come across different
    to the world".</p>
